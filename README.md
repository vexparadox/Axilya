# closedFrameworks v0.495 MAKE VERSION

A basic 2D game framework written in C++, runnable with Make. To see the initial production of this project see: https://github.com/vexparadox/closedFrameworks

This framework is going to be the base of the yet-to-be-named 2D engine I am making for my third year at University, this is the reason for going towards a Unity styled ECS.

Please see the WIKI on how to use this framework. It's not very scary once you get started.
